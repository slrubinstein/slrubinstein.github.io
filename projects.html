<h4>Here are a couple projects I've built</h4>

<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="https://snaproom.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Snaproom</a></h3>

Snaproom is a location-based, temporary online collaboration platform that offers users a quick and easy way to connect and chat, split a bill, decide where to get lunch, or play a game.
Working with my talented colleague <a href="http://navidk-programming.appspot.com/">Navid</a>, we built Snaproom with the MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) and used Socket.IO to allow for real-time communication. We focused on creating Snaproom as a platform where new rooms are treated as modules and can be easily created and added onto the application. This allows for maximum extensibility.
When you hit the Snaproom homepage, you are instantly geolocated so you will only see rooms near you. We really wanted to create a low friction virtual space - you don't need to register or be invited or come up with a unique username. Just open the page, and you can get down to business.
You can open a room anytime you like at <a href="https://snaproom.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">www.snaproom.herokuapp.com</a>

<h3 class="panel-title"><a href="https://chord-substitutor.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Jazz Chord Substitutor</a></h3>

Jazz Chord Substitutor is a single-page application for music composition, focusing on jazz chord substitutions. JCS allows users to easily get chords on the page and knows the chord makeup and common substitutes of any chord you add. Click on a chord to see and hear chord substitutes, and play back your song with new changes.
It was built using the MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) and integrates the web audio API via Audiolet to generate and play back music.
You can read more about the project on my blog.
