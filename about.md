Prior to my career in web development I worked as a reality and documentary TV producer. I worked on a handful of build shows where I learned about house flipping, home renovation, and luxury barn homes. I also scoured photo and video archives, searching for the perfect visual aid to a number of A&amp;E Biographies and the PBS documentary Out in America.
I first began coding as a hobby, a quick brain exercise to accompany my morning coffee. I then found ways of using my new coding skills to automate work tasks, by using regex searches on our data to pull out relevant fields.
Soon I was hooked and have continued to learn and build. In order to escalate my programming skills I enrolled in a web development intensive program at Fullstack Academy. Now I am looking for work as a software engineer.
