<img id="barn-pic" src="../images/barn_photo.jpg" alt="Me in a barn" />

I first began coding as a hobby, a quick brain exercise to accompany my morning coffee. I then found ways of using my new coding skills to automate work tasks, using regex searches to query data and writing scripts to batch rename files.

Soon I was hooked and have continued to learn and build. In order to escalate my programming skills I enrolled in a web development intensive program at Fullstack Academy. Now I am working as a Front End Developer. I aim to turn our designer's wireframes into clean and mobile-friendly interactive web components. In my spare time I build full stack web apps to experiment with other fun technologies, like websockets, geolocation, web audio, and PhoneGap. And I occasionally step away from my computer.

Prior to my career in web development I worked as a reality and documentary TV producer. I worked on a handful of build shows where I learned about house flipping, home renovation, and luxury barn homes. I also scoured photo and video archives, searching for the perfect visual aid to a number of A&amp;E Biographies and the PBS documentary Out in America. This is me at the top of a 30 foot hay ladder, filming a mason drill away at 100-year-old plaster made from horse hair.
