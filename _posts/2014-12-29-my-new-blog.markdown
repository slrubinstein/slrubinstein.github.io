Here is a test post to see if my new Jekyll blog is working the way I think it will. What I'd like to do is seamlessly incorporate this blog platform into my new site, [steverubinstein.net][home], so I can easily organize and control my blog posts. 

These are my goals in starting a blog:

1. I want to practice explaining my thoughts as I continue to learn. I find that if I learn something by working solo in front of the computer, I sometimes have a hard time getting those thoughts out of my head and enunciating them in a clear manner. I hope by writing, I'll have an easier time of explaining my own thinking.

2. I want to learn more about the blogging format of website publishing. I've been working in the same Angular Fullstack paradigm for the last couple months, and I want to widen my perspective by creating a different type of website, one that focuses on posts and updates rather than complex user interaction, data models, server calls, and all those other fun things.

3. I want to open myself up to the coding community on the web. One thing I appreciate about the coding community is the vast number of people sharing their tips and tricks and struggles online. When I get stuck on a problem, I can almost always find someone discussing the same topic after a quick google search. And I appreciate other coders explaining their solutions, thoughts, and methodology. I would like to attempt to give back to the community.

Ok let's see if this blog works...
